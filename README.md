# Cutie
Data app that allows you to send a quick pick up line to a cutie nearby.


## Why Bluetooth vs Geofencing or others?
Simple, bluetooth has a distance limitation which assures you that you are not being catfished from accross the globe. Also, You can still send a pickup line without internet. 
When making this app , I invisioned two people connected at an event or even on the train ride home. 

## How it works
The app is using bluetooth connection to connect to a nearby device. 
When the girl attempts to connect, the person receiving the invitation must accept or decline. 
If accepted, the person who is SENDING the invitation can send a short message containing her pick up line. 
If successful, then they can exchange numbers and take the relation to the next level. 

## Rules
This app is meant to bring people together while respecting eachother's privacy. Because of this reason, there 1 super rule. 
Only Women are allowed to send pick up lines to someone nearby but a MALE or FEMALE can accept the invitation to connect, cool.
Please note that unless you turn on your cutie beacon - NOBODY and I mean NOBODY will be able to send you an invitation to connect. 

## Why am I building Cutie?
Some of us are extremly busy or shy and cannot find the deicated time to look for dates. Cutie allows you to search without interrupting your agenda. 
If you are shy, no worries - In the future we want to team up with "Hitch" to generate pick up lines that will gaurentee a score. 

## Future Features
* generated pick up lines 
* implementing a profile 
* social media link connect 





# One last thing...
Your messages will not saved if the connection is lost. So send a pick up line and make sure you make contact.
